# Auroris
Club Penguin Rewritten's old server emulator; used for production.

Warning: This source code is outdated and contains a few performance issues, including a memory leak. These issues were discovered and fixed in the production version (which is not available publicly). This Github will not be updated with fixes or additions.

All code is owned by Hagrid/Tim and was created for Club Penguin Rewritten (cprewritten.net).

There are no tutorials so to set this up you will need brains and knowledge with Node JS (server sided Javascript) and MySQL.
